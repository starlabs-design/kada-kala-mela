## Issues Found & Resolved

### 🐛 Issue #1: Transaction Validation Error (FIXED)
- **Severity:** High
- **Description:** Zod schema validation failing for transactions due to incorrect `.extend()` usage with Zod v4
- **Error Message:** `"Invalid element at key \"type\": expected a Zod schema"`
- **Root Cause:** `.extend()` method incompatibility with `createInsertSchema()` output in Zod v4
- **Fix Applied:** Removed `.extend()` method, simplified schema to use basic `createInsertSchema().omit()`
- **Status:** ✅ RESOLVED
- **Verification:** All transactions now creating successfully

### 🧹 Data Cleanup: Duplicate Test Data (FIXED)
- **Severity:** Medium
- **Description:** Multiple test runs created duplicate sellers and inventory items
- **Impact:** Inflated counts (11 sellers instead of 4, 22 inventory items instead of 7)
- **Fix Applied:** Used SQL DELETE to clean all test data, re-seeded from scratch
- **Status:** ✅ RESOLVED  
- **Verification:** Final counts match test plan (7 inventory, 10 transactions, 4 sellers)
